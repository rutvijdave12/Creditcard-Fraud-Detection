# Creditcard-Fraud-Detection

Created by Asim Chitre, Rutvij Dave, Shaunak Alshi, Heet Chheda

In this project, we pre-processed and analysed a credit card transaction dataset and used various machine learning algorithms to check which model has the highest accuracy.

We then used ANN as the basis of our model and we then applied it to a payment gateway website which was made using web development technologies.
